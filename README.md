## 📝 Project Description

**ACORDES** is a web application developed with the goal of democratizing music creation through artificial intelligence. It uses the [AudioCraft](https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft) model —specifically MusicGen— to generate musical compositions from textual descriptions. The entire process runs **locally**, without relying on cloud services or third-party platforms.

This project is built with **Python 11**, leveraging its performance capabilities, modern syntax, and compatibility with cutting-edge libraries.

## 🧠 What is AudioCraft?

[AudioCraft](https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft) is an initiative by Meta AI that enables music generation using language and audio models. Specifically, **MusicGen** transforms text into musical audio with remarkable accuracy. In CHORDS, this tool is integrated directly into the server's backend, ensuring independence, privacy, and efficiency.

## 🧩 Technologies Used

- **🐍 Backend:** [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)  
  A robust and scalable Python framework that handles text processing, server logic, and interaction with AudioCraft.

- **🖥 Frontend:** HTML5 + [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)  
  An intuitive and responsive web interface focused on user experience, facilitating interaction with the system.

- **🎵 Music Generation:** [AudioCraft (MusicGen)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft)  
  An AI creative engine that interprets user descriptions and generates music tracks.

- **⚙️ Main Language:** **Python 3.11**  
  This version was chosen for its proven stability and compatibility with the current version of AudioCraft. While not the latest, it guarantees a robust and fully functional environment for local model deployment.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The main goal of CHORDS is to provide an accessible, efficient, and professional tool for music generation using artificial intelligence, specifically aimed at:

- Independent artists looking for inspiration or quick demos.
- Content creators needing original music without relying on audio banks.
- Hobbyists and sound explorers interested in experimenting without technical or economic barriers.

All this, in a **local** environment, with no payment requirements or constant connection to external services.
